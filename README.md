byi: i am visually impaired and use a screenreader, but im unable to on ponytown, so please be mindful of that while interacting. (and dont make your messages disappear fast!! i cant read them in time!!!!!)

*dni if you are outwardly negative for no reason. it isnt a flex or anything, it just makes you unlikeable and hard to interact with.*

(^ this includes telling random people to bite the curb/kts you are weird and should be banned for that)
